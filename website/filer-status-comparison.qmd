## 1. Introduction

This document focuses on the distinctions between the three filing statuses outlined in the 2024 Q1 Submission Data Report – Large Accelerated Filers, Regular Accelerated Filers, and Non-Accelerated Filers – to provide a comprehensive view of how different market segments allocate their resources.
