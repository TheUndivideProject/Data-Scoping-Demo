## 1. Introduction

This document focuses on the distinctions between the three filing statuses outlined in the 2024 Q1 Submission Data Report – Large Accelerated Filers, Regular Accelerated Filers, and Non-Accelerated Filers – to provide a comprehensive view of how different market segments allocate their resources.

## 2. Research Questions

### 2.1. Selection Criteria

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Establish clear criteria for selecting companies within each filing status to ensure a balanced comparison.

1.  **Geographic Location**
    -   U.S. Based

    -   Presence of Environmental Justice Communities: Identified through Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) field data. You can access the data on HOTOSM's GitHub: <https://github.com/hotosm/osm-fieldwork>

    -   Engagement with Digital Divide and Climate Change: Cities with a high presence of individuals and local agencies addressing the intersection of climate change and the digital divide, as indicated by responses to an international survey of emergency managers, disasterologists, planners, resilience professionals, academics, and NGOs.

        # libraries for data manipulation.
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np

        # libraries for data visualisation
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        import plotly.express as px
        import plotly.io as pio

        # libraries for quarto rendering
        from IPython.display import Markdown,display
        from tabulate import tabulate
        import plotly.io as pio

        # remove warnings
        import warnings
        warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning)

        # read in data from 'emergency-manager-survey.csv' in the 'data' folder
        emergency_manager_survey = pd.read_csv('../data/emergency-manager-survey.csv')

        # print Q1-Q7
        display(Markdown("Questions:\n\n" +
                         emergency_manager_survey[['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'Q5', 'Q6', 'Q7']].head(1).to_markdown(index=False)))

        # print data dimensions
        shape_caption = "Data Dimensions:"
        shape_df = pd.DataFrame({
                'Dimension': ['Rows', 'Columns'],
                'Count': [emergency_manager_survey.shape[0], emergency_manager_survey.shape[1]]
            })
        shape_df['Count'] = shape_df['Count'].apply(lambda x: f"{x:,}")
        shape_markdown = shape_caption + "\n\n" + shape_df.to_markdown(index=False)
        display(Markdown(shape_markdown))
        ```

    -   Based on the combined criteria of environmental justice presence and engagement in addressing the digital divide and climate change, the following cities have been identified, listed in alphabetical order:

### 2.2. Sample Size

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Define the optimal number of companies per classification for comparison.

Considering the data size, a sample size of three companies per classification is a good starting point. We can adjust this size if we encounter significant variations within a classification.

### 2.3. Data Points

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Select data points for comparison. This could include R&D expenditures, marketing expenses, compliance costs, and other relevant financial metrics.

### 2.4. Analysis Framework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Develop a framework for analyzing and comparing the resource allocation patterns.
