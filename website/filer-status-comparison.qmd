## 1. Introduction

This document focuses on the distinctions between the three filing statuses outlined in the 2024 Q1 Submission Data Report – Large Accelerated Filers, Regular Accelerated Filers, and Non-Accelerated Filers – to provide a comprehensive view of how different market segments allocate their resources.

## 2. Research Questions

### 2.1. Selection Criteria

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Establish clear criteria for selecting companies within each filing status to ensure a balanced comparison.

1.  **Geographic Location**

    -   U.S. Based

    -   Presence of Environmental Justice Communities: Identified through Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) field data. You can access the data on HOTOSM's GitHub: <https://github.com/hotosm/osm-fieldwork>

    -   Engagement with Digital Divide and Climate Change: Cities with a high presence of individuals and local agencies addressing the intersection of climate change and the digital divide, as indicated by responses to an international survey of emergency managers, disasterologists, planners, resilience professionals, academics, and NGOs.

        ```{python}
        # libraries for data manipulation.
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np

        # libraries for data visualisation
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        import plotly.express as px
        import plotly.io as pio

        # libraries for quarto rendering
        from IPython.display import Markdown,display
        from tabulate import tabulate
        import plotly.io as pio

        # remove warnings
        import warnings
        warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning)

        # read in data from 'emergency-manager-survey.csv' in the 'data' folder
        emergency_manager_survey = pd.read_csv('../data/emergency-manager-survey.csv')

        # print Q1-Q7
        display(Markdown("Questions:\n\n" +
                         emergency_manager_survey[['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'Q5', 'Q6', 'Q7']].head(1).to_markdown(index=False)))

        # print data dimensions
        shape_caption = "Data Dimensions:"
        shape_df = pd.DataFrame({
                'Dimension': ['Rows', 'Columns'],
                'Count': [emergency_manager_survey.shape[0], emergency_manager_survey.shape[1]]
            })
        shape_df['Count'] = shape_df['Count'].apply(lambda x: f"{x:,}")
        shape_markdown = shape_caption + "\n\n" + shape_df.to_markdown(index=False)
        display(Markdown(shape_markdown))
        ```

    -   Based on the combined criteria of environmental justice presence and engagement in addressing the digital divide and climate change, the following cities have been identified, listed in alphabetical order:

2.  **Industry**

    -   Some industries will be more inclined to donate to environmental causes than others.

    -   To reduce bias within each filer status, we can compare businesses within the same industries across different filer statuses.

    -   The following ten industries appear most often in the Submissions Data Set and should thus be prioritized in our research to ensure a representative sample.

    ```{python}

    # read in data from 'sub_data.csv' in the 'data' folder
    sub_data = pd.read_csv('../data/sub.csv')

    industries = [
        "Pharmaceutical Preparations",
        "Real Estate Investment Trusts",
        "Prepackaged Software",
        "State Commercial Banks",
        "Biological Products, Except Diagnostic Substances",
        "Fire, Marine, and Casualty Insurance",
        "Metal Cans",
        "Laboratory Analytical Instruments",
        "Calculating and Accounting Machines, Except Electronic Computers",
        "Miscellaneous Electrical Machinery, Equipment, and Supplies"
    ]

    # count the number of filers for each unique classification code
    classifications = sub_data['CLASSIFICATION'].value_counts().reset_index()
    classifications.columns = ['CLASSIFICATION', 'NUMBER OF FILERS']
    classifications['INDUSTRY'] = pd.Series(industries)


    # show the resulting dataframe
    display(classifications.head(10))

    ```

3.  **Financial Performance**

    -   The Submissions Data Set identifies public float as a criterion for filer status, but that value varies quite a bit within each classification.

    -   To ensure a balanced comparison, our assessment should target filers in the bottom 25%, middle 50%, and top 25% of each classification.

        ```{python}

        num_data = pd.read_csv('../data/num.csv')

        merged_df = pd.merge(sub_data, num_data, on='ACCESSION NUMBER')

        grouped = merged_df.groupby('FILER STATUS')

        ranges = []

        for name, group in grouped:
            public_floats = group[group['FINANCIAL ELEMENT'] == 'EntityPublicFloat']['VALUE']
            
            bottom_25 = public_floats.quantile(0.25)
            top_25 = public_floats.quantile(0.75)
            
            ranges.append({
                'FILER STATUS': name,
                'Bottom 25%': round(bottom_25),
                'Top 25%': round(top_25)
            })

        ranges_df = pd.DataFrame(ranges)

        ranges_df

        ```

### 2.2. Sample Size

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Define the optimal number of companies per classification for comparison.

Considering the data size, a sample size of three companies per classification is a good starting point. We can adjust this size if we encounter significant variations within a classification.

### 2.3. Data Points

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Select data points for comparison. This could include R&D expenditures, marketing expenses, compliance costs, and other relevant financial metrics.

-   The following data points (outlined in the Q1 Numeric Data Report) facilitate the assessment of an organization's expenses.

    -   **Accounting Fees:** provides insights into the organization's financial oversight and auditing practices. High fees can be associated with rigorous procedures.

    -   **Compensation:** provide insights into the organization's budget allocation for leadership compensation.

    -   **Interest:** provides insights into the organization's debt levels, which can inform assessments of financial health.

    -   **Legal Fees:** provides insights into the organization's legal compliance and potential litigation challenges. High fees can be associated with either.

-   In addition, an organization's spending on **Research & Development** can provide insights into its current priorities.

    -   **Research & Development Stats:**

        ```{python}
        import re

        expense_ids = ['ResearchAndDevelopmentExpense']
        expense_stats = pd.DataFrame()

        # add statistics for each identifier to combined DataFrame
        for id in expense_ids:
            filtered_expense_ids = num_data[num_data['FINANCIAL ELEMENT'] == id]
            stats = round(filtered_expense_ids['VALUE']).describe().rename(re.sub(r'(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])', ' ', id))
            expense_stats = pd.concat([expense_stats, stats], axis=1)

        # show statistics
        display(expense_stats)
        ```

### 2.4. Analysis Framework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Develop a framework for analyzing and comparing the resource allocation patterns.

1.  **Create Sample**

    -   **Criteria:** Reference [2.1. Selection Criteria].

    -   **Sample Size:** Three companies per classification (Large Accelerated Filers, Accelerated Filers, Non-Accelerated Filers).

2.  **Create Financial Profiles**

    -   **Use:** 2024 Q1 SEC Submissions and Numbers. Run the following code to create a merged dataset:

        ```{python}
        """
        import pandas as pd

        # load the datasets
        num_data = pd.read_csv('../data/num.csv')
        sub_data = pd.read_csv('../data/sub.csv')

        # merge the datasets on 'ACCESSION NUMBER'
        merged_df = pd.merge(num_data, sub_data, on='ACCESSION NUMBER')

        # save the merged dataset to a CSV file
        merged_df.to_csv('merged_dataset.csv', index=False)

        """
        ```

    -   **Data Points:** Extract the following data points for each filer. Label missing data points 'nan.'

        ```{python}
        data_points = {
            'DATA POINT': [
                'Accounting Fees', 
                'Compensation', 
                '', 
                '',
                'Interest', 
                'Legal Fees', 
                'R&D Expenses'
            ],
            'KEYWORD WITHIN SEC DATA SET': [
                'AccountingFees', 
                'DeferredCompensationLiabilityCurrent', 
                'DeferredCompensationEquity', 
                'DeferredCompensationPlanAssets', 
                'InterestExpense', 
                'LegalFees', 
                'ResearchAndDevelopmentExpense'
            ]
        }

        data_points_df = pd.DataFrame(data_points)

        display(data_points_df)
        ```
